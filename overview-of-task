step1: created github account

step2: created jenkins locally

step3: created Docker desktop for windows 

step4: created minikube(k8s cluster) in windows and used virtual machine manager as virtualBox(oracle)

step5: Took simple Node.js application code for a "Hello, World!" and pushed to github repo and configured 
       webhook for continous integration whenever a changes pushed(used ngrock this enables users to expose local 
       development server to the internet with minimal effort)

step6: In jenkins instelled required plugins and created new pipeline job, used declarative pipeline and 
       created jenkinsfile and made all the stages to be run and execute properly.

step7: Built customised docker image and pushed to dockerhub

step8:started the Minikube Kubernetes cluster and created Kubernetes manifest files for deployment and service resources. 
      Deployed Docker image to the Kubernetes cluster, and made application accessible.



set up of a local development environment and CI/CD pipeline for your Node.js application, and made sure this workflow allows us to automate all the process.
